= clockability

This plugin integrates Chliliproject time logging features with Clockability. The main features provided by this plugin are:

* When a new time entry is created in Clockability (and an issue number is provided), then a time entry is generated in Chili, and it is associated to the corresponding issue.
* When new time entry is created in Chili, it is also generated in Clockability. If the commucation fails, then the Chili item is flagged as pending for later sync.


The integration is based on REST services.
